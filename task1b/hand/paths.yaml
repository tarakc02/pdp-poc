# keys that start with `input_` are dependencies for make

# these are from outside the task:
#   first a real file:
input_task1b: input/names.csv
#   now an output from an upstream task
input_from_1a: ../task1a/output/task1a.csv

# this is an internal, intermediate result
cache_task1b_tmp: cache/task1b_tmp.csv

# this is externally-available, an `interface`
output_task1b: output/task1b.csv

# done.
